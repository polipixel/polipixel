## Some dev steps

We now use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) for our website and our blog posts! 🎉

The posts are in the `_posts` folder. ✏️ 

To compile locally, you have to run `jekyll serve --watch`, and visit [http://127.0.0.1:4000/](http://127.0.0.1:4000/). 👨‍💻

Then, to have the **production version**, run `jekyll build`, and upload only the content of the `_site` folder. 🚀

**Note:** You need to have [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) installed to compile the project's code.
